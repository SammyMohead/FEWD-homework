		<p>I currently work as an Inbound Marketing Specialist at a fast growing startup called, HubSpot in Cambridge, MA. I love helping small, emerging businesses with their online marketing and growth strategies. I'm a Boston native since 1987 and am very involved in the startup community here. Most recently, I've taught classes on Inbound Sales at The Startup Institute and am learning web development at General Assembly.</p>

		<p>
			In my free time I love running, surfing, golf, and skiing. Generally anything that gets you outside, active, and away from the TV is awesome in my eyes. I was a 4-Time NCAA All-American in collegiate track. I don't know if I'll ever be in that kind of shape again, but that doesn't mean I won't try.</p>



		<p>I grew up with my Family in Dedham, MA, attended High School at St. Paul's in New Hampshire, then moved back to Boston in 2009 after I'd graduated college from Trinity in Hartford, CT. I'll be a New Englander and likely a Bostonian for life...</p>
